This project is planning to propose an optimization-based methodology to support the site-product qualification decisions, which site(s) should be qualified to produce which products, for the business of a NAND flash company. As a result, site-product qualification is required frequently; not only the new technologies have been introducing to the production lines, but the configuration of the production network also needs to be optimized for improving the expected profit as well. These decisions are challenging due to a huge number of products with high variation in demand, as they are with many electronic products. Therefore, mathematical programming has been considered in this project as the key technique to improve the expected profit through tuning production network while satisfying the desired service level with essential production flexibility under demand uncertainty. The site-product qualification decisions will be formulated as a stochastic optimization model and a solving framework which integrates multiple optimization models by a solving algorithm, will also be proposed to address this problem. To validate the efficiency and the feasibility of the proposed framework, computational experiments will be provided as a numerical study. Finally, I will analyze and conclude the results with future research suggestion.
